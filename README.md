# Rust Sketchbook
A sketchbook space for testing new concepts in Rust


## Abstract Classes
A sketchbook for implementing abstract classes that are defined in C++ in Rust.

This is based on the example from [this]() medium article. The examples in 
`abstract-classes` aren't exactly the same as what is shown in the article but they 
follow the same themes and patterns.
